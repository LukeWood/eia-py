_Python bindings for the Energy Information Administration API_

## Repo Overview

Our repository consists of two major components: a package `eia-py` and a set of
exploratory data analysis notebooks (EDA).

The package can be found under `eia`.  The package handles data scraping and loading.
The `Notebooks/` directory holds all tools required to perform exploratory data analysis.  The
relationship between the two is that the scripts and notebooks in `Notebooks/` rely on the
package in `eia`.

The `docs/` directory contains the files needed for the dashboard and API documentation page. 

The `slides/` directory contains the slides which were used for the presentation.

The `schema/` directory contains the API Schema details.

## Quickstart

The easiest way to get started is to install from PyPi:

```
pip install eia-py-api
```

Next you'll need to export an API key in your environment variables:

```
export EIA_API_KEY="{your-key}"
```

You can get an API key from [the EIA website](https://www.eia.gov/opendata/).

## Examples

For examples, please check out our [Notebooks directory](https://github.com/LukeWood/eia-py/tree/master/Notebooks).

## Contributing

Contribute to the [eia-py](https://github.com/lukewood/eia-py) GitHub repo.

### Development Setup

To get started working on the repository, please clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/lukewood/eia-py
```

Then install the repo:

```
cd eia-py
python setup.py develop
```

This will link the package.  To test that your installation works, run the following
in a python interpreted of your choice:

```
import eia
```

Then, you need to export an environment variable for the API key:

```
export EIA_API_KEY="{your-key}"
```


### Commits and Pull Requests
